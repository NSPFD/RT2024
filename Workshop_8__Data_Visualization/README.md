# Workshop 8: Data Visualization Techniques

Welcome to Workshop 8 of the Research Training 2024 (RT2024) program. In this session, we will focus on mastering data visualization techniques using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. These tools are essential for effectively communicating data-driven insights in research.

## Objective
By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
- Create basic and advanced visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Develop interactive visualizations with Plotly.
- Apply these techniques to real-world datasets to enhance the presentation and interpretation of research findings.

## Workshop Agenda
1. **Creating Basic Plots with Matplotlib**
   - Introduction to Matplotlib and its components.
   - Plotting basic charts: line graphs, bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.
   - Customizing plots with titles, labels, legends, and annotations.

2. **Advanced Data Visualization with Seaborn**
   - Overview of Seaborn and its advanced plotting capabilities.
   - Creating pair plots, heatmaps, and violin plots.
   - Customizing Seaborn visualizations with color palettes, themes, and context settings.

3. **Interactive Visualizations with Plotly**
   - Introduction to Plotly for creating interactive plots.
   - Creating interactive charts: line charts, scatter plots, and 3D visualizations.
   - Building interactive dashboards with Plotly.
