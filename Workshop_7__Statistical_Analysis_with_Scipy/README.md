# Workshop 7: Data Wrangling with Pandas and Statistical Analysis with Scipy

Welcome to Workshop 7 of the Research Training 2024 (RT2024) program. In this session, we will focus on advanced data manipulation techniques using Pandas, as well as introducing statistical analysis using Scipy.

## Objective
By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
- Clean, filter, and manipulate datasets using Pandas.
- Perform basic statistical analyses using the Scipy library.
- Apply these techniques to real-world datasets relevant to research work.
